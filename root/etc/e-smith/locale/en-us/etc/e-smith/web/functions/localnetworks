            For security reasons, several services on your server are
            available only to your local network. However you can grant these
            local access privileges to additional networks by listing them
            below. Most installations should leave this list empty.</P><P> <a

            from 0 to 255). The server software will zero out the ending (host
            identifier) part of the network address according to the subnet
            mask, to ensure that the network address is valid.  </P><P>

            Local hosts configured on the network you are about to remove have
            been detected. By default, they will also be removed. Uncheck this
            box if, for some reason, you do not wish this to happen. Note that
            they will not be treated as local, and may not even be reachable,
            after this network is removed.
