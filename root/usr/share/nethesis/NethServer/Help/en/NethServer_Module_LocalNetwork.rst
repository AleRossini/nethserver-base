==============
Local networks
==============

For security reasons, some server services are available
only on the local network. Any private networks (eg. networks
connected in VPN) can have the same privileges as the local network
if configured in this panel.

The panel can also be used to configure static routes
which don't use the default gateway (for example
to reach private networks connected via dedicated lines).

remote network to access services of the server.
